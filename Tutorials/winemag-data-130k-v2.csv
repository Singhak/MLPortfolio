5505,France,"The wine is all about firm structure and dense tannins. It is concentrated while hiding rich, generous fruits. It still needs to balance the structure with the fruit. For the future, it will be a rich wine full of power.",,93,,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Clos du Marquis 2011  Saint-Julien,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos du Marquis
5506,US,"Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year.",,93,80,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,,,Duckhorn 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn
5507,Austria,"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017.",Gaisberg Reserve,93,30,Kamptal,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Eichinger 2012 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),Riesling,Eichinger
5508,US,"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",Reserve,93,55,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Gamache 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamache
5509,Austria,"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",Hundspoint,93,17,Weinviertel,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),Grüner Veltliner,Gruber Röschitz
5510,Austria,"Dried fruit flavors and the bitter tang of dark fir honey are spiked by concentrated lemony acidity. The nose and palate are round and rich, but tamed by acidity that runs through like an electric current. This rich, dry but distinctly late-harvest style wine, with just a touch of residual sugar, finishes with triumphant apple fruit and lemon zest.",Seeberg,93,32,Niederösterreich,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Hager Matthias 2012 Seeberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Grüner Veltliner,Hager Matthias
5511,Italy,"Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice. The vibrant palate delivers succulent wild cherry and white pepper restrained by fresh acidity and bracing tannins. It has mesmerizing depth, finesse and balance.

5512,Argentina,"Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern. Finishing notes of coffee, licorice, blackened toast and pepper bring a dark side to this long-lasting, deeply etched Malbec.

5513,Austria,"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure. Rounded fruit with a wonderfully linear trajectory make this a worthwhile food companion. This is a wonderful expression of the indigenous Austrian Zierfandler.",Mandel-Höh,93,35,Thermenregion,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Stadlmann 2012 Mandel-Höh Zierfandler (Thermenregion),Zierfandler,Stadlmann
5514,Austria,"The delicate smoke and hazelnut scent of oak shines through and makes a frame for ripe apricot and Mirabelle plums. The palate is soft and rounded, set off by pizzazz from the lively acidity that underlines the juicy core.",Sauberg Tradition,93,47,Niederösterreich,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Ingrid Groiss 2012 Sauberg Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Grüner Veltliner,Ingrid Groiss
5515,Chile,"Sweaty, briny aromas are borderline offputting. This is plump on the palate, with flavors of pickled citrus fruits. The same can be said for the finish, which is also bitter, resiny and overoaked.",Gran Reserva Estate Bottled,83,20,Casablanca Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Casas del Bosque 2013 Gran Reserva Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),Chardonnay,Casas del Bosque

5518,Chile,"Rubbery, herbal aromas of stalky black fruits are typical of the variety but also gritty and horsey smelling. This has a snappy, grating mouthfeel and flavors of herbal blackberry and plum along with an acid-driven palate. Licorice, oak and vanilla flavors are present on the finish.",Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled,83,12,Maipo Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Santa Alicia 2014 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maipo Valley),Carmenère,Santa Alicia
5519,Chile,"Aromas of green bean, shoe polish, carob and blackberry are heavy and oaky. A creamy weight dominates the palate, which also shows an unbalanced streak of tartaric acid. Herbal blackberry, plum and licorice flavors finish minty, with a resinous oak feel.",Reserva Encinos,83,12,Colchagua Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Santa Luz 2014 Reserva Encinos Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Carmenère,Santa Luz
5520,Portugal,"This is a bright pink-colored wine, with caramel as much as fruit flavors.

5521,Chile,"Rusty and light in color, with a dilute, stalky set of aromas, this thin Pinot is dry, a touch bitter and largely fruitless on the flavor profile. A bland, lightly woody finish tastes stalky and not fully ripe.",Reserve,83,12,Maipo Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Tres Palacios 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley),Pinot Noir,Tres Palacios
5522,Chile,"Latex, earth and briar patch aromas are rough on the nose. Cranberry, red plum, olive and herbal flavors finish a bit sour, with a snappy feel.",,83,8,Maule Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Creación 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Creación
5523,Spain,"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",,83,17,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Don Bernardino 2013 Godello (Valdeorras),Godello,Don Bernardino
5524,Italy,"Here's a frail red that offers weak sensations of sour cherry and strawberry alongside zesty acidity and fleeting, gritty tannins. It's short and dilute.",,83,11,Tuscany,Toscana,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Grati 2014 Red (Toscana),Red Blend,Grati
