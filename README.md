## [Titanic](https://github.com/Singhak/MLPortfolio/tree/master/Titanic)

>The wreck of the RMS Titanic was one of the worst shipwrecks in history, and is certainly the most well-known.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and lead to better safety regulations for ships.

>I applied the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

>Using this [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) I try to do EDA checked the trending feature of terrorist attacks

## [IPL](https://github.com/Singhak/MLPortfolio/tree/master/Bank_term_Deposit)

>In given ipl data set, I did EDA and bring out some interesting statics related to player, team, ground etc.. I tried to find out which ground is best for wining or which player performed well while playing different teams and against other teams. Take a look and enjoy it

## [Bank-Marketing](https://github.com/Singhak/MLPortfolio/tree/master/Bank_term_Deposit)
